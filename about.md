As a Teacher Candidate, I am passionate about engaging students with equity based education. I believe that as a teacher, I have the responsibility to provide an educational environment with choice and opportunity for every student. I approach teaching through a social justice lens in order to make sure students are happy, healthy, and empowered active citizens. Having attended York Universityâ€™s Regent Park program, which focuses on equity and diversity, I design my programs to be cultural relevant to t he students in my classroom, and to promote student voice and student action.
