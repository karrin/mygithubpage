<p>In order to best support student success and engagement, I plan lessons that keep my students’ capabilities in mind while still maintaining high expectations. As a teacher candidate, I work to understand my students’ context in order to design lessons that directly affect them and their community.</p>

<h1 id="global-action-to-citizen-action">Global Action to Citizen Action</h1>

<p><em>Global Action to Citizen Action</em> is a unit that I designed and delivered for a Grade 5/6 class. It began with introducing students to the United Nations and The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, and understanding difference between rights and wants.</p>

<p>The next lesson couple lessons had students form a model UN, acting as countries that reflected the nationalities of the students. During their general assembly, students were dealing with the effects of a natural disaster and attempting to sort out different forms of aid.</p>

<p>The next couple lessons had students learning about different UN organizations, their mission statements and their plans of action. They then chose an issue that they felt passionate about, and created their own UN organization and connecting it how it might effect their local community.</p>

<p>Finally, students moved towards citizen action. We discussed issues that they and their community have been facing. The issues that the students brought up ranged from the lack of technology in their school to the negatives effects of the current revitalization of their neighbourhood. Students wrote letters to the school superintendent and city councillors to expression their concern and their plan for action to work cooperatively with them.</p>

<h1 id="our-planets-our-universe">Our Planets, Our Universe</h1>

<p>At the same practicum placement, I planned a dynamic space unit which included research and student presentations, hands on inquiry, an astronomer as a guest speaker and a field trip to the University of Toronto’s planetarium.</p>

<p>While facilitating a hands inquiry activity, students were able to see and understand why certain places on the Earth experience different seasons depending on the Earth’s tilt during it’s revolution.</p>

<p>In order to provide a more in depth unit on astronomy, I organized to have a University of Toronto Astronomer come into to the classroom to talk about the planets beyond our solar system. He also spoke about the amazing contributions that Islamic astronomers made to the field of astronomy. The Muslim students found this especially interesting and empowering.</p>
